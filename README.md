# CRUD-Employee-Python-with-MySQL
Application developed in version 3.5 of Python.

The function of this application is to perform an employee CRUD with the data storage in the MySQL DBMS.

Note: To create this project was necessary to install the library "pymysql", follow the installation below:

$ # X.X is the desired PyMySQL version (e.g. 0.5 or 0.6).
$ Curl -L https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/pymysql-0.5 | Tar xz $ Cd PyMySQL * 
$ Python setup.py install $ # The folder PyMySQL * can be safely removed now. 

It is also mandatory to have MySQL installed, in my case I used MySQL version 5.7.18 for Linux.
